Explain the different types of data (qualitative and quantitative) and provide examples of each. Discuss nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio scales.\\n    Qualitative data represents characteristics or labels that describe an attribute rather than measuring it numerically. This type of data is used for classification.\\n    Examples:\\n          Eye color (brown, blue, green)\\n          Types of cuisine (Italian, Mexican, Chinese)\\n          Customer feedback (satisfied, neutral, dissatisfied)\\n    Subtypes of Qualitative Data:\\n      Nominal Data\\n        Consists of names, labels, or categories that have no specific order.\\n        Example: Gender (Male, Female), Hair Color (Black, Brown, Blonde)\\n        Key Feature: No ranking or hierarchy.\\n     Ordinal Data\\n        Includes categories that have a meaningful order but the difference between them is not uniform.\\n        Example: Education Levels (High School, Bachelor’s, Master’s), Satisfaction Ratings (Poor, Fair, Good, Excellent)\\n        Key Feature: Ranked data but no precise measurement between ranks.\\n  \\n   Quantitative data consists of numerical values that can be measured or counted. It allows for mathematical computations and statistical analysis.\\n   Examples:\\n        Height of students (160 cm, 170 cm)\\n        Temperature readings (32°C, 50°F)\\n        Number of customers in a store (10, 25, 100)\\n    Subtypes of Quantitative Data:\\n     Interval Data\\n       Numeric data with equal intervals between values but no true zero point.\\n       Example: Temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit (0°C does not mean \"no temperature\"), Years (2000, 2020)\\n       Key Feature: Equal differences between values, but zero is arbitrary.\\n     Ratio Data\\n        Numeric data with equal intervals and a true zero, allowing for meaningful ratios.\\n        Example: Weight (0 kg means no weight), Income ($0 means no income), Distance (0 km means no distance traveled)\\n        Key Feature: True zero allows for meaningful comparisons (e.g., 10 kg is twice as heavy as 5 kg).\\n      \\n2. What are the measures of central tendency, and when should you use each? Discuss the mean, median, and mode with examples and situations where each is appropriate.\\n    Measures of central tendency help summarize a set of data by identifying a central value. The three main types are mean, median, and mode.\\n    Mean: Sum of all values divided by count. Best use case in case of symmetrical data, no outliers, numerical analysis. Avoid in case of Skewed data, outliers.\\n    Median: Middle value when sorted. Best use case in case of skewed data, outliers, ordinal data. Avoid in case of symmetrical data without outliers\\n    Mode: Most frequently occurring value. Best use case in case of categorical data, identifying common trends. Avoid in case of when all values are equally frequent.\\n\\n\\n3. Explain the concept of dispersion. How do variance and standard deviation measure the spread of data?\\n   Dispersion refers to the spread or variability of a dataset. It helps understand how much data points deviate from the central value (such as the mean). \\n   A high dispersion means the data points are spread out, while low dispersion means they are close to the central value.\\n   Variance : Variance measures the average squared deviation of each data point from the mean. It tells us how much the data varies but in squared units.\\n   Standard deviation : The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It brings variance back to the same units as the original data, making it easier to interpret.\\n     \\n4. What is a box plot, and what can it tell you about the distribution of data?\\n   A box plot (box-and-whisker plot) is a graphical representation of a dataset’s spread and distribution. \\n   It shows key statistical values, including the median, quartiles, and outliers, providing a quick visual summary of data distribution.   \\n\\n5. Discuss the role of random sampling in making inferences about populations.\\n   Random sampling is a fundamental technique in statistics that allows researchers to make reliable inferences about a population based on a sample. Instead of studying an entire population, which is often impractical or impossible, random sampling helps ensure that the sample accurately represents the population, minimizing bias and allowing for generalization.\\n\\n6. Explain the concept of skewness and its types. How does skewness affect the interpretation of data?\\n   Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry in a dataset’s distribution. It indicates whether the data is symmetrically distributed or if it leans more toward one side.\\n     Symmetric Data → No skewness (bell-shaped curve).\\n     Skewed Data → More values are concentrated on one side, creating a tail.\\n    Understanding skewness helps in choosing the right statistical tools, avoiding misleading interpretations, and making informed decisions based on data distribution.\\n    The median is more reliable when data is skewed because it is not affected by outliers.\\n\\n7. What is the interquartile range (IQR), and how is it used to detect outliers?\\n   The Interquartile Range (IQR) is a measure of statistical dispersion, showing the range within which the middle 50% of the data falls. It is calculated as the difference between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1). \\n   Steps to detect outliers using IQR:\\n        1.Compute the IQR\\n        2.Define the Outlier Boundaries.( Lower ->  Q1−1.5×IQR . Upper -> Q3+1.5×IQR )\\n        3.Any value outside these bounds is considered an outlier.\\n\\n8. Discuss the conditions under which the binomial distribution is used.\\n   The binomial distribution is used to model situations where an experiment is repeated a fixed number of times, and each trial results in one of two possible outcomes. \\n   These conditions must be met for the binomial distribution to be appropriate:\\n     1. Fixed Number of Trials (n)\\n     2. Two Possible Outcomes (Success or Failure)\\n     3. Constant Probability of Success (p)\\n     4. Independence of Trials (Trials are not influenced by each other)\\n\\n9. Explain the properties of the normal distribution and the empirical rule (68-95-99.7 rule).\\n   The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is one of the most important probability distributions in statistics.\\n    1. The normal distribution is perfectly symmetric around the mean.\\n    2. The graph of the normal distribution is bell-shaped, with the highest point at the mean. \\n    3. The standard deviation determines the width of the distribution.\\n    4. Mean, Median, Mode are Equal.\\n    5. The tails of the normal distribution curve never touch the horizontal axis. They get closer to zero but never reach it.\\n    6. The empirical rule states that 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean, 95% within two standard deviations, and 99.7% within three standard deviations.\\n\\n10. Provide a real-life example of a Poisson process and calculate the probability for a specific event.\\n    A Poisson process is a statistical model used to describe random events that occur independently over a fixed interval of time or space, at a constant average rate. \\n    The events must occur randomly and without any predictable pattern. The Poisson process is typically used in scenarios where:\\n      1.Events happen rarely but are independent of each other.\\n      2.The events happen at a constant average rate.\\n\\n11. Explain what a random variable is and differentiate between discrete and continuous random variables.\\n12.
